                The Soil Fertility Dashboard was created to help Rwandan farmers
                easily determine the right fertilizer blend and application rate
                for their fields. By leveraging historical soil datasets and a Random
                Forest model, this tool provides quick recommendations for popular
                crops like maize, beans, potatoes, and more.
